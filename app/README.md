# Winden Mono

The brand new frontend for the Winden dashboard, built with shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS and in React.

## Building the Frontend

```
npm run build
```

The files will now be accessible in `dist/`. If the app is located inside the Winden directory under `app` then Winden will serve `app/dist/` (as of Aurora 70) to the user. Have a look: `modules/routing.js`.
